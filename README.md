Compass is an [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) based on [TypeORM syntax](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) and [ESLint plugable approach](https://eslint.org/). Our intention here is standardize the connection and implementation of **every database** with the best performance possible, and for this, we use an plugable approach, so more people can contribute and create their on integration. This package alone can't do anything besides typing, the plugins do all the "dirt work".

Currently it only works with TypeScript (and transpiled JavaScript), and we plan to keep this way.

## Why use Techmmunity Compass?

- Easy to use and standardize. Regardless of the database, the implementation will be the same in all cases (except the most complex ones).
- The plugable approach. With the community support, this ORM can work with **all** the databases, be they NoSQL or SQL, as long as it has a plugin for it.

## Install and Config

With Yarn:

```sh
yarn add @techmmunity/compass \
	reflect-metadata
```

With NPM:

```sh
npm i @techmmunity/compass reflect-metadata --save
```

Configure `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"experimentalDecorators": true,
		"emitDecoratorMetadata": true
	}
}
```

## Available Plugins

### [Plugins List](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:techmmunity-compass)

All the Compass Plugins have the `techmmunity-compass` tag, so you can easily found all the plugins in [this link](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:techmmunity-compass).

### DynamoDB

- [@techmmunity/compass-dynamo](https://github.com/techmmunity/compass-dynamo)

## Usage

Compass only supports the [Data Mapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mapper_pattern) pattern, so we can avoid mutability and bad code practices.

```ts
import {
	Column,
	Entity,
	PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
	Repository,
} from "@techmmunity/compass";
// All connections from the plugins follow this naming pattern
import { ExampleConnection } from "example-compass-plugin";

const Connection = new ExampleConnection({
	// Connection config here
});

@Entity()
class FooEntity {
	@PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
	id: string;

	@Column()
	bar: string;
}

type FooRepository = Repository<FooEntity>;

const FooRepository = Connection.getRepository(FooEntity);

FooRepository.save({
	bar: "foo",
}).then(...);
```

## Limitations and warnings

- It's **NOT** our focus to ensure that this is a lightweight lib, so if it's necessary, we will add more things that increase the package size, **BUT** we will try our best to keep the size smallest as possible
- You cannot have two class entities with the same name, or it will cause malfunctioning
- Prefix and Suffix aren't applied to SubEntities fields
- The data used to identify the entities are **stored in memory**, so be careful to not have a memory overload (More entities = More memory required), but relax, it's not that much, you can safely have dozens of entities with no significantly memory usage increase. This package is designed to work with micro-services and serverless applications, so you will only have trouble if you use it in a monolithic application.
